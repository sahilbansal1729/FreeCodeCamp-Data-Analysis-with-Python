### [Data Science with Python Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)

I have done this course from [Freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/). 
<br>This repositry includes lecture notebooks and exercises from that course. I have arrranged them as per the flow of the course.

This course includes five projects included in the [project](https://github.com/sahilbansal1729/FreeCodeCamp-Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/master/Projects) folder with solutions in Jupyter notebook(ipynb format). Although I highly recommend to do this course properly from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)
